# advimport

## What is that

**advimport** is an alternative, more advanced and
automatically managed way to import modules in Python.

**Why?**
It handles missing modules and other things automatically.

**I don't see any code here**
or
**The code here is old**

Check [dev](https://github.com/davix3f/advimport/tree/dev "/tree/dev") branch

## Notes
This import helper sticks to PEP8, so it won't support:
* wildcard imports like `from module import *`
* multiple inline imports like `import this, that, this_one_too`
* Others may come

If you want to do that, you'll have to use the built-in `import`

## Installation
Unfortunately, this modules still doesn't have the ability
to hack into other people's PC and self-install.
Still, you can install it by running

`pip3 [or pip2/pip] install --user advimport`

## Usage
```python
from advimport import advimport

advimport("module")
# Same as 'import module'. Not really useful
# if you are importing a module which is part
# of the included Python library.

advimport("module", name="module_alias")
# Same as 'import module as module_alias'

advimport("big_module", {"submodule1":"submodule1_alias",
                         "submodule2":"submodule2_alias"})
# Same as
# 'from big_module import submodule1 as submodule1_alias, submodule2 as submodule2_alias'

advimport("big_module", "submodule1", "submodule2"...)
# Same as 'from big_module import submodule1, submodule2...'

# Those two syntaxes can be combined, like this
advimport("big_module", {"submodule1":"submodule1_alias"}, "submodule2")
# Same as 'from big_module import submodule1 as submodule1_alias, submodule2'
```

#### Optional arguments
* \<str\> **name**: alternative name for one single import. Set to *None* by default.
* \<tuple\>/\<bool\> **pipfix**: this is the core of advimport. This value is usually set to False, but if set to True, it will try to install the missing modules. Set to (True,False) to automatically start installation, bypassing user confirmation.
* \<bool\> **log**: Set to *False* by default. If set as
True, the output will be more verbose.

```python
from advimport import advimport

advimport("main_not_included_module", "submodule", pipfix=(True,False))
# If the "main_not_included_module" module isn't installed,
# pip will try to install it. 'pipfix' is set as (True, False),
# meaning that it is active (->TRUE<-, False), and that the user
# confirmation is disabled (True, ->FALSE<-), so the module
# installation will begin automatically.
# If you don't like this, run the function as
advimport("main_not_included_module", "submodule", pipfix=True)
```
